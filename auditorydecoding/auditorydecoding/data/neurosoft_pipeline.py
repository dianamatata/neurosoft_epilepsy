"""Base pipeline class for Neurosoft Bioelectronics datasets.

This module provides the NeurosoftPipeline abstract base class that
handles common functionality for processing datasets from Neurosoft Bioelectronics, including:
- Processing iEEG recordings from Neurosoft Bioelectronics.
- Extracting metadata, channels, and signal information.
- Generating train-valid-test splits.
- Creating a Data object.
- Storing the Data object in an HDF5 file.
